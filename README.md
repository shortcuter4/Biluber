## How to run
Here there will be written steps you need to do to be able to run the program.

1. You need to download Android Studio to be able to run the source code. Link available here : 
https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

2. After the installation done, open the project and the first thing you have to do is to sync project with gradle files. 
To do that, go to : Tools -> Android -> Sync Project with Gradle Files (click it) OR just go to : File -> Synchronize (CTRL + ALT + Y)

3. We used firebase database to keep users' data. However you don't need to open the account to run the program.

4. To run the program, you need to have simulator to see the result. If you don't have one, you need to download it from android studio. 
While trying to run the program, you will be asked to create a new virtual device. You need to click "Create New Virtual Device". 
After that, you will be able to open the application and see in simulator.
